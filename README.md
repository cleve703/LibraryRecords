# HTML/CSS/JavaScript Library Records

![Image of Library Records](./library-screenshot.png)

 A webpage that enables the user to keep track of their favorite books by listing key facts about them in table format. Check it out at the following link - [LibraryRecords](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/cleve703/LibraryRecords/blob/main/index.html).

## Purpose

I completed this project as part of the full-stack web development curriculum at [theOdinProject](https://theodinproject.org), in order to learn and demonstrate my proficiency in the use of JavaScript. Specifically, this project focuses on using client-side JavaScript to add, modify and delete items in a table.

## Built With

* HTML5
* CSS3
* JavaScript

## Project Status

As of November 6, 2020, I have completed the assignment as intended. However, in the future I may revisit it, in order to make minor improvements to the overall appearance of the webpage. I may also add persistent storage so that records are not lost upon reloading the page, although this is beyond the primary scope of this assignment.
